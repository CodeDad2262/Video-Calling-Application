Here's an enhanced version of your README file that includes additional helpful information, following best practices and adding sections that provide context and clarity for contributors and users. I've added details such as environment variable setup, testing, troubleshooting, and deployment, which are often crucial for projects like yours.

# Project Name

## Description

A brief description of your project. This is a **Next.js** video conferencing application that allows users to schedule, join, and manage virtual meetings. The application is built with **Stream Video API**, **Clerk for authentication**, and **Tailwind CSS** for styling. It features real-time video calling, meeting scheduling, and a responsive design.

```

## Features

- **Real-time Video Meetings**: Powered by the Stream API, enabling live video calls.
- **Meeting Scheduling**: Users can schedule meetings and share join links.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully mobile-friendly, using Tailwind CSS for custom theming.
- **Authentication**: Users can sign up, log in, and manage meetings using Clerk authentication.
- **Custom Meeting IDs**: Unique meeting rooms are generated for each session.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (>=14.x.x)
- **npm** or **yarn**
- **Stream API**: [GetStream.io](https://getstream.io) account for video conferencing functionality
- **Clerk**: [Clerk](https://clerk.dev) account for user authentication
- **Tailwind CSS**: Pre-installed with the project

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root of your project and define the following variables:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXT_PUBLIC_STREAM_API_KEY=<your-stream-api-key>
STREAM_SECRET_KEY=<your-stream-secret-key>
CLERK_API_KEY=<your-clerk-api-key>
```

For deployment, replace these variables with your production environment values.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```sh
   cd <project-directory>
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
   or
   ```sh
   yarn install
   ```

### Running the Project

To start the development server, run:

```sh
npm run dev
```

or

```sh
yarn dev
```

The development server will start at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Building the Project

To build the project for production:

```sh
npm run build
```

or

```sh
yarn build
```

### Running Tests

If you have test cases in place, you can run the tests with:

```sh
npm test
```

or

```sh
yarn test
```

## Environment Variables

Ensure the following environment variables are set up in your `.env.local` file:

- **`NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL`**: The base URL of your application (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`).
- **`NEXT_PUBLIC_STREAM_API_KEY`**: Your Stream API key for video functionality.
- **`STREAM_SECRET_KEY`**: Your secret key for server-side interactions with the Stream API.
- **`CLERK_API_KEY`**: Your Clerk API key for user authentication.

You can find the API keys from your Stream and Clerk dashboards after creating an account.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions! Here's how you can help:

1. **Fork the repository.**
2. **Create a new branch** (`git checkout -b feature-branch`).
3. **Make your changes.**
4. **Commit your changes** (`git commit -m 'Add some feature'`).
5. **Push to the branch** (`git push origin feature-branch`).
6. **Open a pull request**. Ensure that your pull request passes all tests before submitting.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 404 Errors for Meeting Links

If you're seeing 404 errors when trying to access a meeting link, ensure that:

- **Meeting IDs** are correctly generated and passed in the URL (e.g., `/meeting/{id}`).
- The dynamic route for `meeting/[id]` is correctly set up and handled by `page.tsx`.
- Check the browser console and log `call.id` to ensure it's being generated correctly.

#### Source Map Errors (404)

If you encounter errors like `GET /_next/static/css/app/styles.css.map 404`, it may be related to source map generation. You can disable source maps in production by adding this to your `next.config.js`:

```js
module.exports = {
  productionBrowserSourceMaps: false,
};
```

### Browser Extensions

If you're seeing warnings like `cz-shortcut-listen`, these are likely caused by browser extensions (e.g., Grammarly). These warnings can generally be ignored or tested in Incognito mode without extensions enabled.

## Deployment

For deploying your Next.js app, use platforms like:

- **Vercel** (recommended for Next.js): [Vercel Deployment](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/deployments)
- **Netlify**
- **AWS**

### Vercel Deployment Steps

1. Connect your Git repository to Vercel.
2. Set up the environment variables in the Vercel dashboard (`NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_STREAM_API_KEY`, etc.).
3. Deploy the app.

After deployment, your app will be accessible via the Vercel-provided URL or your custom domain.
